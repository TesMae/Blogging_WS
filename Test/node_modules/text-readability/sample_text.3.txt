Regarding build 78, the concern that YSO has raised has been fixed. But new CL was checked-in for that, so should a fresh build be triggered?
Also Bhawana raised a concern on morning, regarding bug: 1180881,  so should I wait for the issue to be resolved before sending out a mail to Gatherer-ops for sample gatherer deployment?
